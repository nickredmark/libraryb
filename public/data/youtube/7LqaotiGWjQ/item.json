    "description": "What can we trust? Why is the 'information ecology' so damaged, and what would it take to make it healthy? \n\nThis is a fundamental question, because without good sensemaking, we cannot even begin to act in the world. It is also a central concern in what many are calling the \"meaning crisis\", because what is meaningful is connected to what is real.\n\nDaniel Schmachtenberger is an evolutionary philosopher - his central interest is civilization design: developing new capacities for sense-making and choice-making, individually and collectively, to support conscious sustainable evolution.\n\nTo get access to more exclusive content and to join this evolving conversation, become a Rebel Wisdom member: https://www.rebelwisdom.co.uk/plans\n\nYou can listen to a podcast versions of our films on Spotify or Apple Podcasts by searching 'Rebel Wisdom' or download episodes from our Podbean page: https://rebelwisdom.podbean.com/ \n\nWe also have a Rebel Wisdom Discord discussion channel: https://discord.gg/RK4MeYW\n\nFor more from Daniel, he blogs on these topics at https://civilizationemerging.com/\n\nHe’s also the director of Research and Development at Neurohacker Collective https://neurohacker.com/ethos",
