    "description": "For the full show notes visit: https://neurohacker.com/how-we-lost-our-sovereignty-and-how-to-get-it-back-with-jordan-greenhall\n\nWhat is sovereignty, how have we lost it, and why do we need it? These are just a few of the questions discussed and answered on Collective Insights as Neurohacker cofounder Jordan Greenhall joins Daniel for an intriguing conversation. Greenhall sets the foundation for why incentives are the way they are today and why our society should make a transition from Game A to Game B. As a way to accomplish this and help people gain more sovereignty, Greenhall looks at the emergent cryptoeconomic systems being developed and how they might apply in different areas such as healthcare. He also discusses the history of U.S. education and why we need to rethink how people learn in order to promote a greater degree of sovereignty.",
