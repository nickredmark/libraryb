    "description": "In this video Jordan outlines the history and origins of the project, or rather \"scenius\" that has come to be known as game B. He also gives a very personal account of his own path and some of the ways in which his own life and the development of these ideas have  kind of co-evolved. My thanks to Jordan once again for both his time and his candour..",
